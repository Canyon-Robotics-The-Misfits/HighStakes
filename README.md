team 15442c's code for High Stakes

A lot of the code can be found in our custom library: https://github.com/Canyon-Robotics-The-Misfits/lib15442c
This repo contains the driver control loop, drvice configuration, auto routes, and game-specific mechanism code. Math utilities, odometry, drivetrain code, and motion algorithms are all in the library

to use, create symlinks to `./lib15442c/include/lib15442c`and `./lib15442c/src/lib15442c` in `include` and `src` respectively
